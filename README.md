# polyhedra

This is a polyhedron calculator. It's set up to understand how the combinatorics
of doublings of right-angled polyhedra change. This code was for a research project, so may be less-than-accessible to others. If somehow you're actually interested in this, drop me an email I'd be happy to chat.
